ssh-import-id (2.2-0ubuntu1) natty; urgency=low

  [ Scott Moser ]
  * use getopt, send 'info' to stderr, add '--output', LP: #688574
    - support '--help'
    - add '--output' or '-o' option to write downloaded and
      verified data to a named file (supporting '-' for stdout) rather
      that writing to users .ssh/authorized_keys
    - send 'info' output to standard error rather than standard out
      This is required to deal with '--output -'
  * remove carriage returns from key strings (LP: #651698)

  [ Dustin Kirkland ]
  * ssh-import-id.1: updated to reflect smoser's changes
  * debian/install, ssh_import_id, ssh-import-id: allow for URL to be
    admin-configurable, to point to other SSH public key stores besides
    Launchpad.net
  * ssh-import-id.1: document /etc/ssh/ssh_import_id

ssh-import-id (2.0-0ubuntu1) natty; urgency=low

  * Split the ssh-import-id utility out of the openssh package;
    cjwatson doesn't want to see bugs about the tool, nor be bothered
    with the maintenance thereof, hence a new package
  * Relicensing the code and documentation from BSD -> GPLv3
