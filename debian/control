Description: securely retrieve an SSH public key and install it locally
 This utility will securely contact a public keyserver (Launchpad.net by
 default, but Github.com is also supported), retrieve one or more user's
 public keys, and append these to the current user's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
 file.
